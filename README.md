# Black Friday Data Analysis Project

This project aims to sharpen data analysis skills in Python using a dataset of Black Friday shopping data. The dataset includes customer demographic information, purchase details, and product categories.

## Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Dataset

- BlackFriday.csv

## Analysis Steps

1. Import the dataset and drop rows with missing values.
2. Create a box plot to visualize the distribution of purchase amounts by User_ID.
3. Analyze the distribution of Gender and Marital Status using pie charts.
4. Examine the Age distribution and the effects of Age on purchasing behavior using count plots and bar plots.
5. Identify the top 10 products purchased by each Age group using grouped bar plots.
6. Investigate product availability, including top-selling products, top products by sales, unit price distribution, and product category distribution using bar plots and violin plots.
7. Analyze the correlation between purchase and city, including buyer count, consumption amount, age distribution, and years of staying in the city using pie charts, count plots, and bar plots.
8. Determine the products with the largest difference between cities using bar plots.

This project helps me gain a deeper understanding of data analysis and visualization techniques using Python and its powerful libraries.
